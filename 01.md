# Mongo Basics

## Document
A way to store data in the form of set of key value pairs

## Collection
An organized store of documents in mongodb, usually with common fields between documents

## Clusters
Clusters are group of servers that store your data

## Replica set
Are a few connected instances of mongo db that store the same data, so that if one server fails others can still serve data to clients. Every time we make changes to the data redundant copies of it are stored in replicaset

## Mongodb Atlas
It is a database as a service product, that uses mongodb at its core and abstracts the overhead of managing clusters from the user. But it is quite costly when it comes to large scale databases. Atlas is a MongoDB products.

## JSON vs BSON
Mongo db stores data in BSON format, which is nothing but a binary representation of json. JSON had the advantages of being friendly readable and familier, but there are certain disadvantages as well like it being text-based hence space and time consuming to parse, and with limited number of data types. To bridge this gap between binary representation and json format, which provides better speed, space and flexibility which serves gigh performance and general purpose focus.

Data in mongo db is stored and BSON but viewed in JSON

## Import and Export Data

### Export
#### BSON
mongodump --uri "mongodb+srv://<your username>:<your password>@<your cluster>.mongodb.net/sample_supplies"

#### JSON
mongoexport --uri="mongodb+srv://<your username>:<your password>@<your cluster>.mongodb.net/sample_supplies" --collection=sales --out=sales.json

### Import

#### BSON
mongorestore --uri "mongodb+srv://<your username>:<your password>@<your cluster>.mongodb.net/sample_supplies"  --drop dump

#### JSON
mongoimport --uri="mongodb+srv://<your username>:<your password>@<your cluster>.mongodb.net/sample_supplies" --drop sales.json

## Mongo shell queries
To connect via shell
```
mongo "mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster>.mongodb.net/admin"
```

```
show dbs

use sample_training

show collections

db.zips.find({"state": "NY"})
```
Here sample_training is a db, as was video-call in case of pally. In the above string we connect to admin database, which does alot of adminstrative things like keeping track of existing users that have access to the db, local is another administrative db that stores such configurations. Usually we do not touch these dbs.

```
db.zips.find({"state": "NY"}).count()

db.zips.find({"state": "NY", "city": "ALBANY"})

db.zips.find({"state": "NY", "city": "ALBANY"}).pretty()
```

Here zips is a collection inside sample_training database.

When we run find command, we get only 0 queries, to get the next 20 queries we can run it.
